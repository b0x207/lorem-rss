# Lorem RSS

A very simple RSS feed generator that returns random entries with Lorem Ipsum data.

This program only really exists to help with testing programs that consume RSS feeds.

## Building and Running

Build with `cargo build`.

The program can then be run with `cargo run`.

You can specify a port by passing it as a CLI argument (i.e. `cargo run -- your_desired_port`).
It defaults to port 3000 if none is specified.
